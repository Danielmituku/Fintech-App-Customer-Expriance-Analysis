**Potential Review Biases:**
- Negative bias: Users with negative experiences are more likely to leave reviews
- Recency bias: Recent reviews may not reflect long-term app performance
- Selection bias: Only users who download and use the app can review it
- Language bias: Analysis focuses on English reviews, may miss local language feedback

**Limitations:**
- Analysis based on publicly available reviews only
- Sentiment analysis may not capture context-specific nuances
- Theme classification is rule-based and may miss emerging themes
